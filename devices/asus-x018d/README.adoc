The link has been saved to archive.org if it is ever needed in the future.

Note that the tool may appear to fail to unlock, and then fail to format the
device. While this is a big security issue for the integrity of the vendor's
Android operating system, it is only a weird quirk of the device for us. You
can verify that the unlock worked by using `fastboot flash` to flash an image
that would be otherwise rejected (e.g. Mobile NixOS or TWRP).
