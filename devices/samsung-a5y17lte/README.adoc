== Device-specific notes

=== Force-rebooting

To force-reboot the device, hold `Volume Down` + `Home` + `Power` for a couple
of seconds.

=== Odin mode

Holding `Volume Down` + `Home` + `Power` during power-up will go to the Samsung
specific *bootloader* mode.

=== Recovery

Holding `Volume Up` + `Home` + `Power` during power-up will boot the recovery
boot image.

=== Flashing system image

Using `heimdall` to flash `system.img`, either on the `USERDATA` or on the
`SYSTEM` partition seems to fail, for unclear reasons.

One can use TWRP to flash the partitions:

```
 $ adb shell dd of=/dev/block/platform/13540000.dwmmc0/by-name/SYSTEM bs=8M < .../system.img
 $ # or
 $ adb shell dd of=/dev/block/platform/13540000.dwmmc0/by-name/USERDATA bs=8M < .../system.img
```

// As of 2021-01-09, this seems broken, rndis does not seem to work.

An alternative is to temporarily flash the "android burn tool" and use `dd`
through `ssh` to flash the image.

```
 $ bin/ssh-initrd dd of=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/SYSTEM bs=8M < .../system.img
 $ # or
 $ bin/ssh-initrd dd of=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/USERDATA bs=8M < .../system.img
```
