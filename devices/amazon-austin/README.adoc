== Device-specific notes

[NOTE]
====
*Do not acquire any Amazon Fire devices with the intent to run Mobile NixOS on
it.*

They are *not* recommended devices. They are not designed to allow the end-user
to run customized operating systems.
====

This works on top of the *amonet* hack, which allows unsigned images to be
booted on some Amazon Fire devices.

* https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/unlock-root-twrp-unbrick-downgrade-fire-7-ford-and-austin.3899860/

Flashing to `amazon-austin` requires partially disassembling the device at
least once to exploit a boot ROM flaw.


=== Flashing

WARNING: **DO NOT** flash on top of the hacked TWRP. As it is the image is not
modified to hold the "hacked" payload, which means recovery would be unusable.

Only *Using a flashable zip* is supported and works.
